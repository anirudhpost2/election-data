# 2024 American Election Data
##### Using MATLAB, this project is mean to analyze and visualize data from the most recent American election. The data provided separates voters based on gender, age/generation, and policies in order of importance. The purpose of this data visualization is to examine the behavioral trends that may have preceded the election and after the election. As many know, Donald Trump won the election and is currently serving his second term as President. The data visualization could also assist with policymaking, as the interests of the people vary among themselves, and there is an evident disconnect between policymakers and their constituents.
